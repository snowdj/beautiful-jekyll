    "  - In CPSC 340 we used Python so I'll mainly stick to Python packages in this lecture.\n",
    "  - Most deep learning packages are Python-based in any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A popular open-source library is [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), which we've used a few times in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In Assignment 6 you'll use sklearn's [neural network implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor.html). By the way, this was [written by your TA, Issam](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/neural_network/multilayer_perceptron.py#L4)."

    "  - This is like a virtual machine and comes with relevant software installed, etc.\n",
    "  - The AMI costs a bit extra on top of the EC2 costs (say 10%)\n",

    "4. Select US West (Oregon) as my [EC2 region](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html), and p2.xlarge as my [EC2 instance type](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).\n",

    "5. Go back to the EC2 console and click Instances on the left side. \n",
    "6. Wait until the EC2 console lists the Instance State as \"running\"...\n",
    "7. Right-click the instance in the console, and press Connect. Follow the instructions there. \n",
    "  - change permissions on key\n",
    "  - `ssh` into the instance\n",
    "8. Run `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi` so I can monitor the GPU. You'll see it's a [Tesla K80](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-k80.html), which is [not cheap](https://www.amazon.com/HP-J0G95A-NVIDIA-Tesla-K80/dp/B00TWFEIWA). It starts around body temperature.\n",
    "8. And now... go back to the console and get the public IP of the instance.\n",
    "9. Point my browser to `http://{EC2 Instance Public IP}:8888`\n",
    "10. Grab the instance id from the EC2 console: this is the password.\n",
    "11. Create a notebook, paste in the above code. And run!\n",
